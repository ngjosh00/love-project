<h2>LISTEN. UNDERSTAND. VALIDATE.</h2>


<p>Love is about giving. It is about giving yourself fully to another person and your relationship even when things aren't always looking up.</p>
<p>Love is about commitment. Committing to another person and their struggles and helping them achieve their happiness.</p>
<p>Love is about <span style="color:pink; font-weight:bold">YOU</span>. Love is about making sure you are loved first, that way you know how you can better love others.</p>

	<li><b>Listen</b> first. Stop talking. Quiet your mind and find peace and take in what is being said you.</li>
	<li><b>Understand</b> all of them. The feelings, thoughts, passion, emotions, EVERYTHING. Dive deep.</li>
	<li><b>Validate</b> them fully. Let them know they are heard, understood, and valued for being themselves.</li>
